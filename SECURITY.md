# Security Policy

Eclipse EMF.cloud follows the [Eclipse Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php). Vulnerabilities are tracked by the Eclipse security team, in cooperation with the EMF.cloud project leads. Fixing vulnerabilities is taken care of by the EMF.cloud project committers, with assistance and guidance of the security team.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

We recommend that in case of suspected vulnerabilities you do not use the public issue tracker, but instead contact the Eclipse Security Team.

The Eclipse Security Team provides help and advice to Eclipse projects on vulnerability issues and is the first point of contact for handling security vulnerabilities.
Members of the Security Team are committers on Eclipse Projects and members of the Eclipse Architecture Council. You can contact the Eclipse Security Team via [security@eclipse.org](mailto:security@eclipse.org). Note that, as a matter of policy, the security team does not open attachments.

Members of the Eclipse Security Team will receive messages sent to this address.
This address should be used only for reporting undisclosed vulnerabilities; regular issue reports and questions unrelated to vulnerabilities in Eclipse software will be ignored.
Note that this email address is not encrypted.

## Disclosure

Disclosure is initially limited to the reporter and all Eclipse Committers, but is expanded to include other individuals, and the general public.
The timing and manner of disclosure is governed by the [Eclipse Security Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php).
Publicly disclosed issues are listed on the [Disclosed Vulnerabilities Page](https://www.eclipse.org/security/known.php).
