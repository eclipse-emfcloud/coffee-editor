# Coffee Editor IDE - Frontend

This part contains the frontend of the coffee editor IDE shown in the browser.

## Developing with the browser example

1. Start watching changes on the extension via 
   ```
   cd coffee-editor-extension && yarn watch
   ```

   This command starts watching the changes within the extension, e.g. whenever you update any 
   of the source code files within the extension

2. Start watching the browser app via 
   ```
   cd browser-app && yarn watch
   ```

   This command watches for changes within the browser app and rebuils it, e.g. this is the 
   case whenever the coffee-editor-changes finished rebuilding, as the browser has a depedency
   on the extension. Note that rebuilding the browser app might take a couple of seconds. You can
   verify that it finished building the browser-app by looking at the hash of the bundle generated by 
   webpack

3. Start the browser app with 
   ```
   cd browser-app && yarn start
   ```

   This start the browser app on `http://localhost:3000`

**NOTE**: The browser does not reload automatically whenever you changed something, you need to reload yourself currently.
