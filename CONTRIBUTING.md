The ECA provides the Eclipse Foundation with a permanent record that you agree
that each of your contributions will comply with the commitments documented in
the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). Having an ECA on file associated with
the email address matching the "Author" field of your contribution's Git commits
fulfills the DCO's requirement that you sign-off on your contributions.

For more information, please see the [Eclipse Committer Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit).

### Signing the Eclipse Contributor Agreement

You must digitally sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php). You can do this as follows:

The branch name should be in the form `issues/{issue_number}`, e.g. `issues/115`. So please create an issue before creating a pull request.
All branches with this naming schema will be deleted after they are merged.

In the commit message you should also reference the corresponding issue, e.g. using `closes #115` / `closes https://github.com/eclipse-emfcloud/coffee-editor/issues/115`, thus allowing [auto close of issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords).
